2012 FRC ROBOT CODE - TEAM 25 / 103
------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: THIS CODE IS NOT USED AS-IS ON THE
ROBOTS AS IT IS MISSING SEVERAL KEY PORTIONS. THEY
WILL BE POSTED AT THE END OF THE SEASON.

This project contains the robot code shared
between FRC Team 25 and FRC team 103.

Team 25 and 103 have collaborated to build
functionally similar robots. Each robot has its
own peculiarities. However, their functional
equivalence allows for the code to be shared. They
contain the exact same sensors which
has allowed us to simply manage both robots by
configuration changes in the file constants.h

This file will be updated later with detailed
information on the structure of the code, how to
configure it for both robots and the
methodologies used.
